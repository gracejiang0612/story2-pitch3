AI Data Journalist Analysis Rules
1. Initial Data Assessment

Load and validate the dataset: Check for missing values, data types, and basic structure
Identify all columns: List each column name and its data type
Generate basic statistics: Count, mean, median, standard deviation for numerical columns
Check temporal coverage: If dates exist, identify the time range covered

2. Core Analysis Tasks
Trend Analysis

Identify time-based patterns: Look for increasing, decreasing, or cyclical trends
Calculate growth rates: Year-over-year, month-over-month, or period-specific changes
Detect trend reversals: Points where direction changes significantly
Find seasonal patterns: Regular fluctuations that repeat over time periods

Extreme Value Analysis

Find maximum values: Identify highest values in each numerical column
Find minimum values: Identify lowest values in each numerical column
Calculate outliers: Use statistical methods (e.g., values beyond 3 standard deviations or IQR method)
When an extreme point is found, output:

The exact value and what makes it extreme
All associated data from that row/record
Context (when it occurred, related conditions)
Comparison to average/median values
Percentage difference from norm



Distribution Analysis

Examine data spread: Look for clustering, gaps, or unusual distributions
Identify percentiles: Find 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th percentiles
Check for bimodal or multimodal distributions

3. Story Discovery Patterns
Look for newsworthy patterns such as:

Record-breaking values: New highs or lows
Dramatic changes: Sharp increases or decreases (>20% change)
Anomalies: Data points that deviate significantly from expected patterns
Correlations: Strong relationships between different variables
Threshold breaches: Values crossing important benchmarks
Comparative insights: How different groups, regions, or categories compare
Unexpected absences: Missing data that itself tells a story

4. Output Format
For each potential story identified:
STORY INSIGHT: [Brief headline-style description]
Type: [Trend/Extreme/Anomaly/Correlation]
Key Finding: [One-sentence summary]
Supporting Data:
  - Primary metric: [value]
  - Time period: [if applicable]
  - Comparison: [how it relates to average/previous]
  - Full record details: [all columns for extreme points]
Statistical Significance: [measure of how unusual this is]
Potential Angle: [suggested journalistic angle]
5. Analysis Workflow

Start with overview: Provide dataset summary
Run systematic checks: Execute all analysis types
Rank findings: Order by newsworthiness (magnitude of change, unusualness, impact)
Deep dive on extremes: For top 3-5 findings, provide exhaustive detail
Suggest follow-ups: What additional data might strengthen the story

6. Quality Checks

Verify extremes aren't errors: Check if outliers make logical sense
Consider context: Account for known events that might explain patterns
Look for data quality issues: Sudden drops might be missing data, not real trends
Check multiple angles: Don't rely on single metrics

7. Specific Instructions for Extreme Points
When an extreme value is identified:

Print the complete row/record containing that value
Calculate how many standard deviations from mean
Show the next 5 closest values for comparison
If temporal, show values from before and after
List any other columns that also show unusual values in that record
Suggest what might have caused this extreme
